# This folder is based off the the sample `web3` from https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/examples/web3

-   We have built a custom solution based on `web3` sample to host ipywidgets
    outside of `Jupyter Notebook`.

# Warning

-   Most of the code has been copied as is from
    `https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/examples/web3` &
    `https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/html-manager/webpack.config.js`.
    -   Please try to minimize changes to original code to facilitate easier
        updatess.

# Solution for IPywidgets

-   IPywidgets traditionally use [requirejs](https://requirejs.org).
    -   `traditionally` as there seems to be some ongoing work to use
        `commonjs2`, though unsure how this will work with 3rd party widgets.
-   Using 3rd party widgets require:
    -   [requirejs](https://requirejs.org) to be available in the current
        browser context (i.e. `window`)
    -   Base `IPywidgets` to be defined using `define` in
        [requirejs](https://requirejs.org).
-   Rather than bundling using `amd` or `umd` its easier to just import
    everything using `commonjs2`, then export for `requirejs` using `define` by
    hand.
    -   `define('xyz', () => 'a')` is a simple way of declaring a named `xyz`
        module with the value `a` (using `requirejs`).
    -   This is generally done using tools, however we'll hand craft this as it
        works better and easier.
    -   `amd` is not what we want, as out `react ui` doesn't use `amd`.
    -   `umd` is does not work as we have multiple `entry points` in `webpack`.
    -   Heres' the solution
        `define('@jupyter-widgets/controls', () => widgets);`
-   We bundling the widget controls into our JS and exposing them for AMD using
    `define`
    -   We could instead include
        `https://unpkg.com/browse/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@0.18.3/dist/embed-amd.js`
    -   However this is a 3.2MB file.
    -   Then our Widget manager also needs the widget controls. That would mean
        widget controls get included twice, once in our bundle and the other in
        the above mentioned `embed-amd.js` file.
    -   Solution is to include everything thats in `embed-amd.js` into our
        bundle.
-   We need types for `requirejs`, but installing this into `node_modules`, for
    extension causes conflicts as we use `require` in standard node (extension
    and UI).
    -   Solution is to just copy the `@types/requirejs/index.d.ts` into the
        `types` folder.

### Directions for building

You might want to setup an npm link for the python repository

-   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter.git
-   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter-ipywidgets.git
-   cd vscode-jupyter-lsp-ipywidgets
-   npm link
-   cd ..\vscode-jupyter
-   npm link @vscode/jupyter-ipywidgets (the name of the node module in python)

Then to build vscode-jupyter-ipywidgets

-   npm run download-api (updates vscode.d.ts)
-   npm run webpack (which will setup stuff for using with vscode-python)

### Directions for debugging with jupyter extension

-   Run the steps above for getting the npm link setup
-   From with VS code, open both jupyter and lsp-middleware as two folders
-   Build the 'webpack link' task for lsp-middleware
-   Build the compile task for jupyter
-   Set breakpoints in the dist/node/index.js file while debugging (it's a
    development webpack)
-   Edit lsp code
-   Rerun the 'webpack link' build every time (it doesn't watch as it runs a
    post build step)
